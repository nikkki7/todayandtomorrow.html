<br><font size="4"><p><b><u> Today we are still scared of the corona virus<br>
we are still in lockdown, because the pandemic<br>
is not yet over,Early evidence suggests the variant of coronavirus that emerged in the UK may be more deadly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.<br>
However, there remains huge uncertainty around the numbers and vaccines are still expected to work.<br>
The data comes from mathematicians comparing death rates in people infected with either the new or the old versions of the virus.<br>
The new more infectious variant has already spread widely across the UK.<br>
Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing: "In addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first identified in London and the south east  may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.<br>
"It's largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure." <br>
